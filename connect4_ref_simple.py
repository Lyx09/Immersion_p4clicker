"""
    A connect 4 game (scalable version of a project)
    The game consists of a grid (6x7) where two players put one coin
    by turn in a column by clicking on the button at top of the column.
    The coin falls to the bottom of the grid, or on top of a previous coin.
    When 4 coins are aligned (on a line, column or diagonal), the game ends.
    If nobody has won but the grid is filled, the game is draw.
    The player 1 has red color, the player 2 has yellow color.
    The players can resize the grid by entering integers in 2 entries
    and selecting "Set Dimensions" button
